[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, it's gon' be a long long time 'fore we stop
Boy better know, they better know who make the scene pop
All I ever needed was a chance to get the team hot
Only thing I fear is a headshot or a screenshot
Pree me, dem a pree me
You know they only ever call em when they need me
I never go anywhere, they never see me
I'm the type to take it easy, take it easy
I took girls in the very first text I sent
I don't beg no lovers, I don't beg no friends
If you wanna link, we can link right now
Skeppy Wiz and Drake, it's a ting right now
Are you feeling good tonight

[Verse 3: Skepta]
When I was in school, being African was a diss
Sounds like you need help saying my surname, Miss
Tried to communicate
But everyday is like another episode of Everybody Hates Chris
Ever since mum said, "Son you are a king"
I feel like Floyd when I'm stepping into the ring
Just spoke to the boy, said he's flying in with a ting
We're touching the road to celebrate another win, we're going in
Why am I repping these ends? Man I don't know
The government played roulette with my postcode
All I know is it's where my people dem are suffering
I seen it before, narrate the story as it unfolds
Dad certified the settings and my mum knows
My mind full of more bullets than your gun holds
Now I got the peng tings in the front row
Saying, "Skeppy come home, baby come home!"
Yeah, I love the sun but I respect the rain
Look forward to good times, can't forget the pain
I was the kid in school with the £10 shoes
White socks, jack-ups and the pepper grains
Said they're gonna respect me for my ambition
Rest in peace my niggas that are missing
I had to tell my story cause they'd rather show you
Black kids with flies on their faces on the television

[Bridge: Wizkid]

This thing got me thanking God for life
I can’t explain
I can’t explain eh yeah

Joy

[Verse 1]
Oh nananana
Eh eh
In the early 90s
That was the beginning
Mama had me
She was definitely smiling
Finally a boy
She was very very happy
She prayed for those with the love of her life eh
She called me grace
She called me blessing
She looked into my eyes
Called me love of her life
I wish i could go back and feel what she felt
But she goes on her knees
And tell God what she felt eh

[Chorus]
Joy nothing but joy
Every other day she feels nothing but joy
Showers of blessings
God blessed her plenty
Thank God for blessing
Love of my life eh
Joy nothing but joy
Every other day she feels nothing but joy

She loved me still
When she thank God for blessing love of my life eh
