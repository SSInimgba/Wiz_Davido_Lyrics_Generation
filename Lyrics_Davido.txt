Get up and pray and get the money afterwards (church)
Pockets never been deeper
Bitches never been shallower
If I throw a couple Geez up
And she'll prolly let my shadow fuck
And, she'll do it for a half a nut
She ain't take it to the reap

Fuck me fifty times, this some
Told her I ain't play no games, ain't no Playstation
My dreads gettin' long and my niggas Haitian
I gave that bitch a bone just to penetrate
Baby I ain't never home, man I'm overseas
No US dollars, I got chrome faces
Pop a bean, get you eat out
Chains on my neck stand and they stay out
Every time she wanna fuck she come say, "may I?"
And call me mister if you want this payout
I stay at home in the bed all day
Bitch gave me head, I could play all day
Pussy comin' in, I get
I think bitches comin' in, I get slayed all day

[Chorus: Davido]

All I do is strike out, I don't never spare
Petty ass hoes, all these bitches welcome
All these bitches ready
If she in my bedroom then the bitch naked
Gotta get that back end
Big money on my mind, every minute, every second
Elevator to the top, where you headed?
I fuck her 'til I'm sweating
She been throwing that pussy ever since she met me
Said she lookin' for love, I say forget it
Nut on her back and that's where I left it
Snoop in with the camera when she undressing
She gon' do it for me like Simon said it

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
I been smokin' loud, yeah I wanna hear you yeah

Would you be, would you be there for me?
Girl, would you, girl, would you care for me?
Would you come running for my needs on the double?
Come and bail me out when a nigga get in trouble
Give me that loving wherever we lie
Poke, poke, poke, poke in the back of my car

Brace yourself, girl, 'cause I'm dangerous
Might be bragging, but I backs it up
So come try me, try me
Girl, you, girl, you, girl, you won't regret what I give you
Love like no other lover

Back when (feat. naeto c)

Yea On the beat (Yes o)
On the beat, it's Davido and Super C
Back when I was broke yo
Nobody wanted to jonze yo
All the girls they tell me no-no
Because I no get e motor
Dem dey used to hate me
All the same people don they hail me
All the marketers want to pay me
All the club DJs don dey play me
Now dey don dey follow
Everybody wan snap photo
Looking like I just hit the lotto
And you know that my neck is froze yo
And i am popping Rose
Every night na money we dey trowey
Balling from Monday to Sunday
Balling from Monday to Sunday (Sunday)
And I'm counting owo
I'm known from Yankee to Sango
All the girls dey wash me like omo
All the girls dey wash me like omo
And I'm counting owo
I'm known from Yankee to Sango
All the girls dey wash me like omo
All the girls dey wash me like omo (Wash me like omo)

Because I no get e motor
And dey used to hate me
All the same people don they hail me
All the marketers want to pay me
All the DJs want to play me (want to play me)
Ma nogere Now dem don dey see me

Nobody just want to free me (just want to free me)
And I am talking my way
These days I be wishing my way
All the girls from Funke to Laide
Bad girls, from Funke to Laide

After doing what needed to be done
They say I ball too much like Testes
Recognize a boss when you see one
Not in the same tax bracket that you belong
Like the next …………
To all the haters who exchanges things small or less
My money they say cut like money fresh
Not matching Mohammed, I mean Benjamins
Whole ‘nother class, not talking about the Benz I am in
See me sharing money like communion
To last my flow too tight like the lungs have asthma
Back when I was broke yo
Nobody wanted to jonze yo
All the girls they tell me no-no
Because I no get e motor
And dey used to hate me
All the same people don they hail me
All the marketers want to pay me
All the DJs want to play me (want to play me)

(Ice Prince)
Yeah, oh
It's all good, now I'm blowing perf
See every time you scream, got me going tone deaf
You're overseas and I am trying get my own jet
So you ain't gat to worry about a nigga having phone sex
Ain't nothing compared to when we both flex
But when we argue you got me shaking on both legs
Now all the smileys and cute faces in those text really means shit no more, kinda of gross yet
You forget about the sick romancing
How you shake a nigga head is like sisqo dancing
Fryna be your bad boy, you pick those medicine
I ma go to J'burg and let the chicks know something
But currently i'm ego ranting, you ain't got enough to hear me, no eco sensing
Set things straight, mama me no blanking
If you tryna push aside, well me no skanking
Every time we fight about who is wrong or right
Pushing each other every day and night
Why can't we make things right
Pass me the, let me feel alright, let me feel alright
Pass me the, let me feel alright, let me feel alright
Every time we fight about who is wrong or right
Pushing each other every day and night
Why can't we make things right
Pass me the, let me feel alright, let me feel alright
Pass me the, let me feel alright, let me feel alright

The Sound (Remix)

[Chorus: Davido]
See my baby, the way I love you, no deny eh
And i'm loving the way you dancing to the sound eh eh
Oya baby, move your body to the sound
Now Uhuru, kalawa jazmee na the sound

[Intro: G-Eazy / Remo]
You know if I say something I mean it
These things happen
Yeah
If I ever said I'm never scared

[Chorus: Davido]
See my baby, the way I love you, no deny eh
And i'm loving the way you dancing to the sound eh eh
Oya baby, move your body to the sound
Now Uhuru, kalawa jazmee na the sound

See my baby, the way I love you, no deny eh
And i'm loving the way you dancing to the sound eh eh
Oya baby, move your body to the sound
Now Uhuru, kalawa jazmee na the sound

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
If I say that shit then I mean it
She calls me, I screen it, I'm only fuckin' if it's convenient
You lie on pussy, that's weak shit
We pass pussy 'round, that's G shit
But you ain't fam so what is this "we" shit?
You cuff yours and then leash it
Listen, I'm tellin' you, it's my world, I does what I wish to
If you're mad well too bad, sounds like a personal issue
I walk in, they all stare like "Who the fuck is this dude?"
Kicks game is just rude, don't get jiu-jitsued
Tunnel visions how I get ahead, stayed solid I never fled
My haters feel like I'm better dead
But I'm quite alive getting bread instead
With a better girl, with a better face
I'm in a better place gettin' better head
"I just wanna stay broke forever,"
Yeah that's that shit no one ever said

[Hook: Remo]
Never scared
Just know I mean it
If I ever said I fucked your bitch
Just know I mean it
And if I ever said I'm gettin' money
Just know I mean it
And oh Lord oh Lord knows
He knows I mean it
Yeah, you know
Oh yeah oh yeah

[Chorus: Davido]
See my baby, the way I love you, no deny eh
And i'm loving the way you dancing to the sound eh eh
Oya baby, move your body to the sound
Now Uhuru, kalawa jazmee na the sound

See my baby, the way I love you, no deny eh
And i'm loving the way you dancing to the sound eh eh
Oya baby, move your body to the sound
Now Uhuru, kalawa jazmee na the sound
